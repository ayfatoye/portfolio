            <h2>L.A.S.S.O </h2>
            <p class="about-me-text">

                L.A.S.S.O (Liaison Acquisition System for Sponsor Outreach) is a script designed to automate the process of cold emailing sponsors or recruiters who might be interested in sponsoring your student organization's events. <br><br> With L.A.S.S.O, you can conveniently reach out to potential sponsors and schedule your emails for specific times when recipients are more likely to check their inboxes, thereby maximizing the chances of your email being read. <br><br>

                Prior to this project, I had never worked with th GMail API, or Google Apps Script, so this was on opportunity to learn said topics whilst making a tool I could personally use in my day to day! <br><br>

            <p class="about-me-text">

                RecordRecords is a web-application that allows Managers at RecordRecords--a fictitious luxury Record store--the ability to efficiently manage the store's daily business. <br><br> Its features include customer creation/management, purchase record keeping, records inventory handling etc.<br><br>

                Prior to this project, I had never worked with Python or Flask, so this was a great way to learn a new language and framework while building a project I can be proud of alongside other engineers! <br><br>

            <h2>Dungeon Crawler</h2>
            <p class="about-me-text">

                One of my personal favourite projects, I used c++ to make a dungeon crawler application that can be enjoyed from the comfort of your very own terminal. This nostalgic project was an amazing way to practice my c++ while making a game I can play in my terminal during breaks.<br><br>

                This project holds such a special place in my heart, as it was the very first game I ever developed. I worked on it during my first semester studing computer science, and up until this project, coding concepts weren't clicking for me. However, working on something that excited me--a game--gave me the motivation to make things click. <br><br>
